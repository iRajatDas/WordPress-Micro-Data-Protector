Easy tool to stop HTML editor from removing schema.org/microdata tags from post or page content.

#How Does it Works?

Wordpress HTML editor (TinyMCE) treats schema.org attributes like itemscope/itemtype/itemprop as invalid HTML attributes and strips them when you save the post or page content. This plugin alters this behavior and prevent the Wordpress HTML editor from removing the schema.org/microdata markup.

## How to Install

Just install the plugin as usually and activate it. Once activated, it will keep your markup from being removed by the HTML editor. No setup required.
